# Find Joomfette (The 4%)
An application that partially replicates the Wanted! minigame from Super Mario 64 DS, but with custom sprites themed after Juniper Actias's mascots.
Sprites and code modifications were created by me.

Written in Python, which means this requires Python 3 and the pygame package to run.
Instructions on how to setup both of them are included in the script comments.

* Koji Kondo - Wanted! (Super Mario 64 DS soundtrack)
